        "An interview in four parts with Carmel Chapman, who works at the Wentworth Information Centre.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1941, Carmel talks about her life growing up in Merbein, near Mildura, on the Victorian side of the Murray River. She recalls fishing with family and swimming as a teenager in the Murray, \"...we used to be able to see our feet in the water...\". In her youth she did research on the floods; and as an adult she communicates her extensive knowledge of the river through her employment.\r\n\r\nIn the interview Carmel discusses: local history of the Murray-Darling; water allocation and building of weirs; a cofferdam; soldier settlements in Wentworth; the 1956 flood and assistance by soldiers during this time; seasons; water volumes; rainfall patterns; dependence of the Murray River on Darling River flows.\r\n\r\nShe mentions weirs at Wentworth, Burtundy, Mildura and the unique Perry Sandhills, 400 acres of shifting dunes, marked by a Murray River Red Gum Tree (Eucalyptus camaldulensis). Called the God Tree, it is over 500 years old, and covered so much by the sand that you can stroll through its canopy."

        "An interview in four parts with Bill Lever.\r\n\r\nBill, a professional fisher since 1953, resides in the small town of Wentworth in northern Victoria. Born in 1926, his life experiences of the neighbouring areas of the Murray, Darling and the Great Darling Anabranch reveal numerous changes to the region in terms of fish, crustaceans, the fluctuating commercial demand of fish, and the health of the river systems. Bill also discusses his preferred fishing techniques, areas he likes to fish, government regulations, and the impacts on his region that are a result of irrigation and farming further up the basin.\r\n\r\nHe also talks about: yabbying in the Paroo River; finding large mussel populations in billabongs; drought and flood cycles of the 1960s, 1970s; differences in water quality and its decline since the 1950s; reduction in water quality in the Culgoa River since the St George Weir was built; the impact of European Carp on Catfish, little water snails and mussel beds."

As an executive member of the Northern Basins Aboriginal Nations (NBAN) group, Michael is concerned about the health of the basin and wetlands and attributes much  of the basin's issues on poor water flows, poor management of available water and the siltation caused as a result. He urges that the wetlands be registered with an international treaty: the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, in order to help ensure its survival.\r\n\r\nMichael explains the cultural and spiritual importance of the river systems to Indigenous peoples, delving into the history, language and stories of his Ualarai people. The changes in the fish population, and the traditional practices of his people that were implicit in the flourishing of the basin prior to colonisation. \r\n\r\nMentioned: water rat, mud crab.\r\n\r\n"

        "An informal interview with Henry and Joan Cross. No audio was recorded.\r\n\r\nHenry and Joan Cross live at Goonaroo Station, an 11,000 acre sheep and cattle property. The property is located north of Hebel on the New South Wales and Queensland borders and was purchased by Henry's father. The Bokhara River cuts through their property.\r\n\r\nHenry was born at the property 85 years ago. In the river he has caught Catfish (5-6 lbs), Yellowbelly (3-5 lbs), and many Crayfish. One time, he was stung by a Catfish barb. Henry used to use cloth line for fishing, and would bob for fish as there were no lures back then. He could even tell the different fish species from their bites (bite impressions).\r\n\r\nThe rivers used to run clean. Big worms (up to 2 feet long) were the best bait to use for fishing, and he still sees these worms around.\r\n\r\n'Tea Tree Hole' was the most popular place to fish before the weir was built. In the drought of 1958 the hole went dry, and he remembers pulling dying Murray Cod out, but didn't like to eat Cod as they tasted bad.\r\n\r\nHenry spent a considerable amount of time on the river with family. Most picnics were on the Culgoa River where the fish were better, the Narran River even better than the Culgoa.\r\n\r\nHe first noticed the fishing holes fill with silt about 30 years ago. Now trees fall into the holes, which hold up the silt and built-up material. Siltation began before European Carp arrived. The river ran clear before the 1970s and 1980s. Weeds used to grow on the water, but do not any longer.\r\n\r\nSiltation now blocks the weirs. Blackwater (black) floods take the oxygen out of the water, killing fish. Dirranbandi saw many dead fish. Thousands of fish died there, including Cod 3 feet long. Trucks were used to load and bury the fish.\r\n\r\nNow Culgoa River gets the most water. The weed is dead and it used to have [Red Carp/Spangled Perch/'puppy dogs']. Vegetation on the river used to be River Red Gums, Coolabahs, and the occasional Tea trees and Lomandra.\r\n\r\nToday's fishing is very poor. The river has dried out many times - three times after the weir was built in 1958, however, on the property the water is 'very good'."

        "An interview in two parts with Robert Lacey.\r\n\r\nRobert Lacey is an Indigenous man who has resided in the St George area in southern Queensland most his life. His people are the traditional owners of the land: his mother is a Mandandanji woman, while his father is a Waka Waka man. \r\n\r\nRobert discusses the connection he has with the land and the river, he expresses the honour he feels in being trusted to take care of Country. He discusses the history of the river and its declining health; commercial use of the river; and the work he personally does on recording the sites of cultural significance and heritage sites finding over 100 in just a few years. He says that the river is a source of peace, tranquility, food, leisure - the life blood of the land.\r\n\r\nRobert also mentions the Great Artesian Basin Sustainability Initiative (GABSI) and his elation at the 1967 Australian Referendum and what it meant for Aboriginal people, and also the political activism by his family."

        "An interview with Peter and Margaret (Pop) Petersen.\r\n\r\nPeter and Margaret (Pop) Petersen  were the former managers of Brenda Station in Goodooga. On the Culgoa River, it spans both New South Wales and Queensland. Previously owned by the Church of England, Brenda Station was primarily involved in grazing sheep and cattle. The Culgoa River which runs through the property, was a major source of feed and water for the Petersen's and their community. Peter and Pop reminisce about the pleasant experiences had on Brenda Station and discuss the course of events leading to the less than ideal conditions that the river is currently in. They also talk about: the long term benefits of floods; the changes in flows as a result of irrigation and intense agriculture; differences in water colour (red Maranoa, black Darling Downs); Artesian bore drains; Aboriginal tools found on the property.\r\n\r\nThe Petersens have maintained records of rainfall, river height, and floods that date back to 1872.\r\n"

        "An interview with Pat Stephens, a local butcher.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1933, Pat talks about fishing in the Dirranbandi area and the changes he has noticed over the last 60 years. Having fished since he was a boy, the biggest changes have been a reduction in the smaller, regular floods since E.J. Beardmore Dam was built. These small floods used to wet a large area of the country, which were essential for grazing purposes. He notes the effect of the dam on river flow, and how the water does not clear up like it used to.\r\n\r\nHe also talks about: the impact of European Carp on fish populations over the last 30 years; a flood in the 1890s; floodplains and the effect of river water levels on trees; fishing techniques, such as lures; and the decline in Crayfish since bore drains were removed.

These changes include the installation of weirs, the growing cotton industry, the decimation of the Catfish population, droughts, and Aboriginal culture he has observed in the Angledool area over the years. Rory also expresses his appreciation for the river and the floods that it brings, recognising it as a powerful and fascinating force that replenishes the land.\r\n\r\nHe also discusses how European Carp came into the water system during the 1974 flood; the importance of floodplains to the breeding cycles of fish; Aboriginal scarred trees, and evidence of large gathering sites (remains of shell middens); the Chinese population in the area and the environmental impacts of the rice industry.\r\n\r\nMention of the the Flood Plain Association and Water Act (Queensland)."

        "An interview in two parts with Ned and Lynette Underwood.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1932, Ned grew up as a child on the property Warroo, a sheep and cattle station on the banks of the Balonne, owned by his grandfather since 1890.\r\n\r\nIn the interview, Ned describes how the river was a significant part of his life growing up - like a playground, swimming and fishing. He recalls what the river was like prior to the E.J. Beardmore Dam being built downstream and how it increased the river level along much of their property; the turbidity of the river; and the history of the station as a site of importance for the Aboriginal peoples of the region - recalling stories of tribal warfare, and several locations with remains of shell middens.\r\n\r\nNed has kept records of flood locations and heights, which have been helpful in predicting how flood waters might affect the local area. He also discusses 'gilgais' - an Aboriginal word for small water hole or lake, thought to be formed in vertisols.\r\n\r\nMention of Warroo Station as a sacred Aboriginal site."

        "Ned and Lynette Underwood reside on a cattle and sheep station in Warroo. The Warroo Station, where Ned grew up, has been in his family for three generations since 1890 when his grandfather purchased the property. \r\n\r\nIn this interview Ned describes how the river was a huge part of his life growing up. He remembers learning to swim there, visiting there after mustering with his brother, Dick, and  fishing -  he says it was like a playground.\r\n\r\nNed also delves into the history of the station mentioning a shepherd who previously resided at the property whose personal diaries are being held by the University of New England that describes the local Indigenous tribes at war with one another, and the relationship between the Indigenous peoples and the farmers."

        "The data from this study region includes 12 oral histories (audio as mp3s, and transcripts) and 7 image galleries, as well as a georeferenced hand-drawn map of the area.\r\n\r\nThe Condamine River is one of the major tributaries of the Darling River System. It rises in the Border Ranges then makes its way along the eastern part of the Darling Downs region in Southern Queensland, becoming the Balonne River near Glenmorgan.  It waters one of Queensland's richest agricultural regions. Intensive land use and development has resulted in a very different river to that of years ago. The floodplains are easily eroded and with the arrival of hoofed stock the Condamine River changed and now the catchment is degraded significantly. Over 60% of the aquatic habitat is now considered in poor condition. \r\n\r\nTwenty thousand years ago, the Barunggam, Bigambul, Giabal, Kambuwal, Githabul and Jarowair people knew a different Condamine River that flowed year round. With much of the water in the Condamine River flowing underground, spring fed creeks and waterholes were permanent water sources utilised by fish and traditional owners alike.\r\n\r\n(Source: Sarac, Z., Sewell, H., Ringwood, G.

        "The data from this study region includes 7 oral histories (audio as mp3s, and transcripts) and 3 image galleries, as well as a georeferenced hand-drawn map of the area.\r\n\r\nBourke was once the end of the line for most of the paddlesteamers that made their way up the muddy Darling. They sometimes had to wait for months before the waters became navigable and when the rains didn’t come, the channel dried to a series of pools.\r\n\r\nSince the coming of Europeans, the health of the river and its fish have degraded. The paddlesteamer trade, grazing, and irrigation, all changed the rivers. Weirs were constructed, reaches desnagged, water extracted, foreign animals and plants introduced and new ways to catch fish also had an impact. These changes mean there are now a lot less fish than there were. Before the turn of the twentieth century there are stories of catching great numbers of silver perch, Murray cod, catfish and yellowbelly - and no tales of carp.\r\n\r\nThese are the traditional lands of the Ngiyampaa, Murawari and Yuwalaraay peoples. They have seen great changes to the river and surrounding waterways where they fished and hunted the wetlands. \r\n\r\n(Source: Frawley, J., Nichols, S., Goodall, H. and Baker, E. 2011.

The Upper ‘Bidgee floodplain is only a couple of hundred metres wide, a stark contrast to the kilometres‐wide floodplains in other parts of the Murray‐Darling Basin. When the floods come, they come up quickly and roar through the narrow valleys. \r\n\r\nSince Europeans arrived the health of the river and its fish has been shaped by the people who came to live there and the industries that developed. Mining and grazing, and the development of Canberra brought new people with new needs. Once, river levels would rise with the spring snow melt before falling slowly over the summer. Today the snow melt is collected in Tantangara Dam before being returned to the ‘Bidgee below Burrinjuck Dam. The river between these dams is a shadow of its former self.\r\n\r\nThese are the traditional lands of the Ngunnawal and Ngarigo peoples. They fished the river and surrounding waterways and the seasonal rise and fall of the water guided their travels and featured in their stories.\r\n\r\n(Source: Frawley, J., Nichols, S., Goodall, H. and Baker, E. 2011.

        "The data from this study region includes 18 oral histories (audio as mp3s, and transcripts) and 6 image galleries, as well as a georeferenced hand-drawn map of the area.\r\n\r\nThe Goulburn River rushes westward down from the steep hills and mountains of the Great Dividing Range toward Seymour. The river then turns northward and meanders through hills and plains until the river meets the Murray upstream of Echuca. \r\n\r\nThese are the traditional lands of the Taungurung, Bangerang and Yorta Yorta peoples. However, the Goulburn River today is not the river the Taungurung, Bangerang and Yorta Yorta once knew and fished.\r\n\r\nWater is now stored in Lake Eildon and controlled by Goulburn Weir at Nagambie. Flows peak in summer to meet irrigation needs and drops off in winter/spring. These changes mean there are a lot less fish than there were. Before the turn of the twentieth century, there are many stories of catching Macquarie perch, Murray cod, trout cod, blackfish and yellowbelly. There were no carp, no redfin and no trout. Now, there are very few Macquarie perch and no trout cod.\r\n\r\n(Source: Frawley, J., Nichols, S., Goodall, H. and Baker, E. (2011).

        "The data from this study region includes 12 oral histories (audio as mp3s, and transcripts) and 4 image galleries, as well as a georeferenced hand-drawn map of the area.\r\n\r\nThe Murray River is the boundary between NSW and Victoria. The river both defines boundaries and unites them with the waters that sustain townships, irrigation and the floodplain forests, including the 70,000ha of the iconic Barmah and Millewa Forest. The river and its floodplain are the traditional lands of the Yorta Yorta and Bangerang people. The Murray is a very different river to the one the Yorta Yorta and Bangerang peoples once knew and fished.\r\n\r\nToday, flows in the river are controlled by Hume Dam – the first of 15 structures on the main channel. By the time it reaches Corowa, the Murray has changed from a small clear stream to a fast flowing river, its waters tea brown. Near Yarrawonga the Murray enters Lake Mulwala, where the skeletons of old drowned red gums are a stark memorial to the way the river’s changed.\r\n\r\n(Source: Frawley, J., Nichols, S., Goodall, H. and Baker, E. 2011.

Its 9,000 hectare grey clay floodplain is covered with blackbox, saltbush and lignum. The creek’s horseshoe lagoons,\r\nmarshes and islands are the traditional lands of the Meru peoples. \r\n\r\nToday, Katarapko’s red gum and river coobahͲlined waters leave the Murray near Lock and Weir 4, rejoining the river 16km later. Katarapko has seen many changes as its waters were blocked, floodplains grazed, and surrounding irrigation districts flourished. Berri Evaporation Basin and Katarapko Island Disposal Basin have both taken a toll as they collected salty irrigation drainage water.\r\n\r\n(Source: Frawley, J., Nichols, S., Goodall, H. and Baker, E. 2011.

        "The data from this study region includes 7 oral histories (audio as mp3s, and transcripts) and 4 image galleries, as well as a georeferenced hand-drawn map of the area.\r\n\r\nAfter gathering water from 23 river valleys, the Murray empties into Lakes Alexandrina and Albert before making its way to the Coorong and out the Murray Mouth to Encounter Bay in South Australia. The entire Murray‐Darling Basin is upstream. Everything that happens there affects what goes on here. Wind is almost a constant here. Nothing separates this unique piece of Australia from Antarctica and the full brunt of the Southern Ocean. \r\n\r\nThe River, Lakes and Coorong are part of the traditional lands of the Ngarrindjeri people. These waters provided food and featured in their stories. The Ngarrindjeri people have seen their land and river change. As well as being uniquely affected by changes upstream, the Lower Lakes, Coorong and their fish have been shaped by industries like sheep and cattle grazing, commercial fishing and tourism have all brought new people into the area, with new needs and new ways to catch its fish. \r\n\r\nThe Lower Lakes and the Coorong once formed one big estuary where fresh and saltwater mixed. The Lakes only became salty during droughts. Now, barrages separate the freshwater from the salt and the Lakes from the Coorong. Flows from upstream have declined so much that in recent years a dredge has been used to keep the Murray Mouth open to the sea.\r\n\r\n(Source: Frawley, J., Nichols, S., Goodall, H. and Baker, E. 2011.

        "The data from this study region includes 11 oral histories (audio as mp3s, and transcripts) and 4 image galleries, as well as a georeferenced hand-drawn map of the area.\r\n\r\nGeographically the Balonne is an extension of the Condamine River and starts near Glenmorgan. It flows through gently undulating country before reaching an expansive flat plain where it splits and forms several smaller rivers including the Culgoa. The Culgoa River twists and turns across the floodplain and through coolabah woodlands before flowing into the Darling River between the towns of Brewarrina and Bourke.\r\n\r\nThe 123 000km2 catchment of the Culgoa – Balonne Rivers is semiͲarid and experiences a highly variable rainfall. The rainfall is reflected in the rivers’ flows which often cease for long periods of time, sometimes for up to a few years. During such prolonged droughts only very large waterholes continue to hold water. When the rains are good, the whole floodplain may turn into a slow flowing river around a metre deep.\r\n\r\nThese rivers are significant to the Bigambul, Kooma, Muruwari, Gungarri, Mandandanjii and Gamilaroi people who have traditionally lived, fished and told stories about these rivers and the life they support.\r\n\r\n(Source: Sarac, Z., Sewell, H., Ringwood, G., Baker, E. and Nichols, S.

        "The data from this study region includes 6 oral histories (audio as mp3s, and transcripts) and 3 image galleries, as well as a georeferenced hand-drawn map of the area.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Darling River and Great Darling Anabranch are located in southͲwest New South Wales. Muddy waters meander over the grey soil floodplains past red dunes, spiky saltbush and gnarled red gums. These are the traditional lands of the Paakintji people. But the land and the river are no longer what the Paakintji once knew and fished.\r\n\r\n11 000 years ago, the Darling River changed its course just south of Menindee Lakes, leaving the Great Anabranch’s 460km channel to dry and flow into the Murray only during big floods. Since its discovery by Europeans, the Great Anabranch has been the focus of dreams to use the ancient river channel to deliver water for irrigation. The Darling itself was once a busy transportation route, with paddlesteamers carrying wool and other goods between Bourke and the rest of the colony.\r\n\r\n(Source: Frawley, J., Nichols, S., Goodall, H. and Baker, E. 2011.

        "The interviewee speaks of how she came to live on the Far South Coast. She and her husband felt it was the best place to raise kids. Active lifestyle, healthier, 'clean', and there is a strong sense of community. Mums meet at the beach and share child minding. \r\n\r\nShe comments on how different the culture is from when she, as a girl, would go to the beach and just lie in the sun. Now daughters of friends are engaged in the action: surfing, spear-fishing, diving.  She surfs with other mums in her area and her husband's colleague encouraged her to join the Board Riders club. At first she was reluctant, having seen how competitive board riding was when growing up in the Wollongong area, and how the boys made fun of the girls, who had just recently got involved in the competition. But she went along and loved the supportiveness. She speaks of the charity work the club does, usually to support women or coastal communities. She describes the unique feeling of surfing, tuning into the ocean, how a friend told her surfing can be anti-depressant. \r\n\r\nShe talks about her young son's relation to the beach and ocean, mixed love and awe. They loved the Council’s Marine Debris Challenge which encouraged everyone to pick up as much plastic rubbish debris as they could find washed up, and then take photos of it, for the Council website. Debris is known to wash up from ships as well as littering on land, and is noticeably worse in holiday seasons.\r\n\r\nOther topics included fishing exemptions in sanctuary zones and special permissions for Aboriginal peoples to conduct net fishing. Organisations and events mentioned: Nature Coast Marine Group; Clean Up Australia; Marine Debris Challenge; Landcare."

In some communities, like South West Rocks, commercial fishermen are working hard to rebuild the connection between the community and fishers by holding an annual Good Friday mullet BBQ. This event, known as the ‘loaves and fishes’, is well attended every year by the local community and includes displays on the historical importance of mullet to South West Rocks history. Proceeds from the day are donated to the local surf lifesaving club."

He recalls selling bait to tourists with his brother and talks about his father selling fish during The Great Depression. \r\n\r\nGary discusses man-made and environmental changes in water quality, river flows and and river height and talks about their effect on fish and crayfish behaviour. He says that the Willow has an outsized effect on the shape and path of the river and talks about his efforts to replace them with native plants.

        "An interview in two parts with Adam Pascoe and Ron Dawson.\r\n\r\nAdam and Ron talk about the conditions that fish find  favourable to breed in. They recall the effect of the Black Saturday Fires (2009), the 'chocolate river' event, and the Yarrabulla mudslide (2006/2007). They also make reference to the 1939 black water event. They speak of the decline of the tobacco industry and the anecdotal belief that fish have rebounded as a consequence. Ron remembers his time serving on the Ovens River Management Board, renamed Northeast Waterways and later the Northeast Catchment Management Authority. He talks about  environmental politics and his experience advocating for the restoration of fish habitat and biodiversity. Adam talks about his involvement with the Northeast Catchment Management Authority and  their efforts to replant native species and reintroduce snags. \r\n\r\nThey both talk about fishing lures, setlines, springers and keeper nets. They mention snakes, competitive fishing, snorkeling, and discuss what they like about fishing.\r\n\r\nMention of sugar gliders, platypus, phascogale, eastern water rats, bandicoots, tiger snakes, red belly black snakes, brown snakes, black snakes.\r\n\r\nMention of Arthur Rylah institute, Ovens River Improvement Trust, Ovens River Management Board, Northeast Waterways, Northeast Catchment Management Authority, Mulwala Classic Invitational, Cod Opening Classic, Myrtleford Fishing Club"

        "An interview in three parts with Greg Sharp.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1964, Greg Grew up in Croydon, Melbourne, before working as a fisheries officer in northern Victoria. He shares his experience in freshwater fish research and surveying, and explains the influence of fires, farming, pests, weeds and floods on the river ecosystem. He mentions a big Yabby catch in 1994 and a particularly destructive black water event at Broken Creek. \r\n\r\nHe discusses changes in fishing culture, noting an increasing awareness and concern for the continuity of species and environmental sustainability. Greg says that these attitude shifts express themselves in different ways, from the sponsorship of vegetation regrowth programs, the introduction of catch limits and size restrictions, and to the practice of catch and release, \r\n\r\nHe also talks about fishing further afield in California, Mexico, Canada, England, Kenya, and Juneau, Alaska, where he ate fermented raw fish with indigenous people. \r\n\r\nMention of Yarra Valley Fly Fishing Club, Deepdene Fishing Club, Monash University, Healsville Sanctuary, Fisheries and Wildlife, Californian Conservation Core, Freshwater Fishing Australia magazine, Murray Cod Classic\r\n\r\nMention of Garfish, 'Rainbow Fish', and bardigrubs, Willows"

He reflects on the variance of fish populations over time, and notes how the perception of introduced species has changed. He discusses the future of the River and the Basin's wider management. This includes reference to the draining of Lake Mokoan. He also touches on changes to fishing regulations and the evolution of illegal fishing surveillance.\r\n\r\nMention of: River Trust, Fisheries and Wildlife, Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE), Beech Grove Trout Farm."

        "An interview in two parts with Gary Hera-Singh.\r\n\r\nGary is a commercial fisher in the Lower Lakes and Coorong Fishery for 28 years; a third generation fisher on his father’s side, and a fifth generation fisher on his mother’s side (lineage to the Rumbelow family, and whalers from Victor Harbour, South Australia). His family came to the Lower Lakes in the 1930s. Gary lives and grew up in the Meningie area, four-hundred metres from Lake Albert. Gary discusses the three different habitats – marine, estuarine (the most productive system), and fresh water. He recalls life as a youngster working at his grandfather’s fish processing business. He has not been able to fish commercially in the Coorong south lagoon for 20 years due to hyper-salinity, and is concerned about the government’s targeting of commercial fishers and fisheries rather than habitat degradation. The low-tech, high physical-input nature and rotational harvesting of the fishing industry is a factor in its sustainability. The Lower Lakes and Coorong Fishery incorporates Lake Albert, Lake Alexandrina, the Coorong from Goolwa to Salt Creek, the ocean from Goolwa Beach Road to outside Kingston. The Coorong relies on Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria.\r\n\r\nGary talks about: differences in fishing over 80 years from family history and personal observation ‘every year was different’; history of the Coorong and Lower Lakes Fishery, documented since 1854; the commercial fishing industry in Meningie (including when the coastal road through Meningie and Coorong was main route to Melbourne from Adelaide); history post World War II, including native vegetation land clearing; changes in licensing, which were freely available until mid-1970s when zoning occurred; commercial fishing registration, which influenced fishing behaviour (return on investment) due to administrative load; monthly ‘Catch and Effort’ data reported to government; health of region before construction of barrages 1935-40; the reduction in estuary size of Lake Alexandrina; changes to fish ecology separating salt from fresh water; changes to flood patterns; declining river flows; water extraction; degradation of habitat and lifecycles of estuarine-dependent species; bait fish industry (rock lobster market); the chain affect of water hyper salinity in the South Lagoon on species; brine shrimp – evidence of salinity and system collapse; rate of water release from lakes into the Coorong and sea; high percentage of carp in Lake Alexandrina; ground and surface water flows; 1981 closing of the Murray mouth; acid-sulfate soil; fishery closures in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia; Riverland Fishery (most sustainable model); importance of fish ways to their movement upstream; certification in 2008 of the Lower Lakes and Coorong Fishery; parallels in fishing methods with historical methods; traditional knowledge transfer, Ngarrindjeri peoples.\r\n\r\nGary also discusses the flood of 1956, and a severe drought in the last five years where water levels dropped a metre below sea level.\r\n\r\nOther fish mentioned (unspecified species): Australian Salmon, soft-mouthed Hardyhead. Gary discusses an interesting relationship between Dandelion plants and fish movement.\r\n\r\nOther mentions: President of Southern Fisherman’s Association (Gary has historical minutes of meetings); Murray-Darling Basin water management plan; Department of Environment; Department of Water; Riverland Fishery (South Australia); Fisheries Act; Marines Stewardship Council Certification; World Wide Fund for Nature, Scheme of Management; Department of Fisheries; South Australian Research Development Institute."

        "An interview in six parts with Tracy Hill.\r\n\r\nTracy is a partner in a sustainable commercial fishery, which achieved Marine Stewardship Council certification in 2008. She lives in Meningie and is a member of the Women’s Industry Network and Vice President of the Southern Fisherman’s Association. Tracy expresses concern about the misinformation in discussions around commercial fishing, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and the imbalance in commercial and unregulated recreational fishing. She also discusses the activities of the Women’s Industry Network.\r\n\r\nTracy talks about: the significance of wind power on water movement and fish catch in the water systems; hypersalinity of Coorong South Lagoon; difference between brackish and salty water; brine shrimp – evidence of salinity and system collapse; history behind the construction of barrages, and the sudden changes in fresh/salt content with their opening/closing; Total Allowable Catch (TAC) quotas; Riverland Fishery; Lakes and Coorong Fishery; changes in commercial licensing and fishing methods (e.g. type of nets used); impact of fur seals in the area; harvest rotation (freshwater, estuarine, saltwater) and low-tech, low-impact fishing; management of the Narrung bund (between Lake Albert and Lake Alexandrina); acid sulfate; blackwater from anabranches; public outreach about commercial fishing activities; carp extraction. Other species mentioned: tubeworms (build ‘bombies’ or coral-like tubes), crab, rock lobster, fur seal. Note: Yellowbelly (Golden Perch) are known as Callop in this region of the Murray-Darling Basin.\r\n\r\nTracy also mentions: South Australian Research Development Institute (SARDI), Pew Trust, Marine Scale Fishery, Murray-Darling Basin Plan, Water Act, Women’s Industry Network, South Australian Seafood Industry Awards, Sea Net (Ocean Watch), Regional Development Board, Marine Stewardship Council, PIRSA Fisheries, Ramsar Treaty, National Parks Act, Lower Lakes and Coorong Infrastructure Committee."

        "An interview with Brian Schulz, a recreational fisher, who grew up in the Barossa Valley, fished on the Murray, and moved to Murray Bridge in 1980. Brian ran a fishing competition called 'Fantastic Fisherama' at Walker’s Flat and Big Bend in the 1970s, which drew up to 800 contestants and received an Australia Day Award. One of Brian’s passions is protecting the Murray cod.\r\n\r\nBrian talks about: native fish activity in the Sturt Reserve, in particular Murray Cod and their habitat; the importance of river flow on fish breeding cycles; the changes in baiting methods from live bait to lures; banned fish net practice; petitioning against commercial fishing in South Australia; the changes he has observed in water levels in the Murray River, including vegetation; 1956 flood; blackwater; water salinity; traditional knowledge (pinpointing the birthplace of a Murray Cod from its stomach lining); and the different species of Callop in South Australia.\r\n\r\nMention of a silver fish 'tookeri' and a 'scarfish'."

        "An interview in five parts with Terry Sim and John Yelland. Both men were born in 1952 and lifelong friends, recreational fisherman, and landholders in Milang. They discuss in great detail history reaching back to the 19th century. Terry started the fish section of the South Australian Museum in 1974.\r\n\r\nTerry and John collectively discuss: pre-barrage days, when a blue line was visible, separating fresh from salt water in Lake Alexandrina (which is now freshwater); changes in fishing methods and equipment; a time when the Mulloway fish species were captured for their gelatine; history of flows and currents in the Coorong from the southern end, as a result of drainage schemes; salinity from agricultural soils and runoff; hypersalinity of the Coorong; traditional knowledge and legends of the Ngarrindjeri peoples; comparisons in flooding and rainfall between 1956 flood and the present day; the dairy and agricultural industry and trade routes in the 1950s; history of prominent naturalists studying the area; the Strathalbyn Nationalist book, an extensive repository of vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants in the area; South Australian Naturalist surveys; observation of fauna in the 1950s-60s and consequent changes; popular family and community activities (e.g. fishing, yabbying, hunting); history of boat types and fishermen huts (‘shacks’); dredging and acid sulphate soil issues; methods of catching and transporting fish (and duck); the impact of salinity on the small snails in the food chain of duck species; vegetation (weeds) popular to ducks; and the effect of European carp in the 1970s on the swan population; 1956 flood, and a family story about a 1870 flood; plant species.\r\n\r\nThey discuss a fish species 'disostra' in the Coorong and worldwide that died off in the early 20th century. They talk about water birds, and a species called a Banded Stilt which feeds on brine shrimp - a sign of hypersalinity. \r\n\r\nAlso mentioned: the South Australian Farmers Union, which became Southern Farmers, then National Foods."

Married since 1960, Dean and Sally live at Mundoo Island near the mouth of the Murray River. Dean recalls memories fishing with his father, and spear fishing with mates at Victor Harbour in the ocean. They talk extensively about the changes in fish species and vegetation they have seen at Mundoo Island and other parts of the Coorong and Lakes systems.\r\n\r\nDean and Sally talk about: changes in vegetation at Mundoo Island due to salt (brackish) water; fishing methods and equipment used in the ocean and lakes (including a pitchfork to catch Flounder); seeing dead Murray cod from upstream in the 1956 flood; natural movement of Congolli species from fresh to saltwater; activities of cockling, floundering, and yabbying; local Aboriginal culture; the effects of wind power on the water system; marine species (e.g. shark, seal, stingray, turtle) in the Coorong; and the severity of recent droughts compared with earlier ones.\r\n\r\nOther fish species mentioned: tcherie/turie/toukrie, salmon trout, sunfish, pyebrie, garfish, whiting.

        "An interview in two parts.\r\n\r\nRon Bain was born in 1918 on a farm in Seymour. After share-farming for six years, he bought his own farm in Timboon. He returned to Seymour and purchased a shop with his family and after 12 months had packed up to travel around Australia in a caravan with his wife which continued for seven years. After this trip, Ron returned to Seymour and has resided in the area ever since.\r\n\r\nDuring his life in Seymour, Ron has witnessed a lot of changes to the Goulburn River. He notes the reduced flow of the river as well as the eradication of floods, which in turn have negatively impacted the cod population and dried out the lagoons. He blames this largely on the installation of the Eildon Weir, and also on low precipitation.\r\n\r\nMentioned:\r\n\r\nSandworms, bardi grubs, trout, turtles, platypus, snakes, tiger snakes, red river gum trees, black wattle, rabbits."

Fishing for him initially began as a social activity with his friends where they would camp, drink and fish along the riverbank. Fishing practices in those times, Donnie admits, were unconcerned about sustainability - this is in complete opposition to the sustainable practices that Donnie employs today. \r\n\r\nNowadays Donnie is equipped with his boat and fishing gear that he uses in the various competitions that he has entered, including the Barra Nationals, the Barra Classsic, the Barra Bonanza, the Barra Bash, and the exclusive Mulwala Classic. Donnie also speaks about lure fishing and lures, his taxidermy works, and the various plants and wildlife along the river.\r\n\r\nMentioned:\r\nRiver Red Gum trees, turtles, platypuses, willows, bream, bardi grubs."

        "An interview in three parts with Kingsley Abdulla.\r\n\r\nKingsley is from the Gerard Aboriginal community in South Australia. Born in 1971, he has always lived on the river; camping with family and extended family, a time for Elders to educate the younger generations about Country. Kingsley shares his knowledge of a changing and interconnected landscape.\r\n\r\nKingsley talks about: teaching family to swim and fish; yabbying methods; a period when Catfish species were rare; salinity (water and ground table) issues and low water levels; lack of ‘decent’ floods; Aboriginal grave sites and culture, native bushes, and native vegetables impacted by environmental degradation (e.g. traditional medicinal methods); the role of wetlands and back creeks (backwaters) as nurseries for all animals; the impact of Willow tree removal on Murray Cod and Callop; different types of soil in the area; changes observed in water colour; hybrid knowledge systems (incorporating Western into Aboriginal), and the desire to learn from each other. Also mentioned: snake species; water birds; vegetation; Crown Land.\r\n\r\nIndigenous terms for fish species discussed:\r\nMurray cod - Gadu, Pondi’s Gadu;\r\nYellowbelly - Thaigai; Pilaki\r\nCatfish - Gaigai;\r\nBony bream: Thukeri\r\nSilver Bream - Tookaree;\r\nSilver Perch - Bungi.\r\n\r\nOne of the images in the collection includes a book called 'Tucker' by Ian Abdulla (1947-2011). It is a children's illustrated book about an Aboriginal boy who grows up along the Murray River, when bush tucker was plentiful.\r\n"

        "An interview in seven parts with Eric ‘John’ Aston.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1942, John held a commercial licence between 1956 and 1997. He discusses his family history in commercial fishing since 1918, three generations. His grandfather was also a boat maker. He tells the story of how ‘Squabbily Creek’ at Murtho Forest came to be named by his father Raymond Charles ‘John’ Aston. In those days, buying a fishing reach meant buying good will, not the water. John talks extensively about professional fishing as a family business, and gives a sense of the long hours of labour the whole family put into making fishing nets and boats. Professional fishing has an important memory status amongst people who live along the river. \r\n\r\nJohn talks about: fishing licenses, and the licence system introduced in 1922; fishing equipment; fishing practices, since 1920s; changes in fishing materials and the introduction of synthetics, 1960s; changes in water levels from irrigation; impact of Dartmouth Dam on River Murray flow; Hume Dam levels; flows from the Darling; water colour and clarity; three distinct water colours (in the Murray, Lachlan/Murrumbidgee, Darling); changes to water levels with the building of weirs and locks, late 1920s; objects he has found in the guts of Murray Cod; 1956 flood; 1992 flood – ‘a complete change of fish’; Chowilla Floodplain, 1991-1993; movement of wildlife in floods; salt from irrigation. (Mention of 'bream' fish, unspecified).\r\n"

        "An interview in four parts with Tracy Bye.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1964, Tracy is Manager of the Loxton Information Bureau. She moved to Loxton when she was about 11, and spent a lot of time at Katarapko Creek. Tracy saw her interview as a way to honour her father Colin Shultz, his love of the river, and the way the river became integral to their life once they moved to Loxton. Tracy’s interview is short but rich in terms of showing how recreational fishing, family life and place making environments are intertwined.\r\n\r\nTracy talks about: camping, fishing, swimming, and skiing on the river; recreational fishing methods from boat and river bank; yabbying methods; changes in water quality (visibility and colour); changes in water vegetation (weeds and reeds); worm farming; observations of change sin water flow and current; snags and debris in the river; an occasion when carp became stuck in wetlands after a high water event; the differences between the river at Albury and Katarapko Creek; floods 1970s."

        "An interview in three parts with Howard Hendrick.\r\n\r\nBorn in Renmark in 1923, Howard lives on the banks of the Murray River at Pyap, near Loxton. He grew up in an underprivileged First World War settlement in Renmark, spending school holidays helping his father on the land picking dried fruit and tending to animals. Howard was a Royal Australian Air Force pilot and bomber in World War II, and commercial pilot for British Airways. When he returned with his brother from WWII he took up an ex-serviceman block near Loxton.\r\n\r\nHoward recalls history about: soldier settlements after the First Word War (Renmark, Berri, Barmera, Waikerie); the mix of cultures in the population as a result of the World Wars; training at an army camp at Victor Harbour, and training as a fighter pilot at Deniliquin in 1942; the sinking of the Australian Hospital Ship Centaur; experiencing WWII first hand on the south coast of England and as a bomber pilot over Germany.\r\n\r\nHoward also discusses: fishing at Ral Ral Creek growing up, a tributary of the Murray River; changes in fish species (the main three being Cod, Callop, Bony Bream); the number of trees and shade along the river bank; fishing methods used on the river bank, and types of bait (e.g. birds to catch shrimp, mussels to catch cod); changes observed in minor and major flood cycles; changes in salinity, and the resulting changes in irrigation practice in the Riverland; yabbying techniques and where they were most abundant; bird nesting and water bird species; snakes; vegetation; floods 1931 (Renmark), 1951, 1956, 1959 (Berri).\r\n\r\nAlso mentioned: Tree of Knowledge (Berri, marked with flood levels).\r\n"

        "An interview in five parts with Wally Cooper, a  Moitheriban man, and Pat Larkin.\r\n\r\nWally talks about traditional fishing, fishing women, tickling fish, fishing with spears, hand lines, baiting, canoe fishing and diving for Crayfish. He also mentions cross lining and the use of drum nets in floodwaters. He marvels at the dexterity and play habits of water rats, and reflects on their scarcity. He discusses their history of being hunted, skinned, exported, and in some cases, eaten; He says it is customary that only male elders eat water rats and use their skins (men's-business).\r\n\r\nOf the river, Wally and Pat discuss sustainable fishing practices, and talk at length about the Basin's wider management. They consider local agriculture, irrigation, habitat management, water allocation, floods, droughts, pests, weeds, silviculture, as well as the rivers' recreational and fish industries. \r\n\r\nWally and Pat refer to a chemical era, when DDT and Dieldrin were used as a pesticide on vinyards and Tobacco crops along the River. They talk about the chemicals, their effects on native fish, the contamination of farmland, and the ecological footprint of Tobacco growing itself.\r\n\r\nMention of Moira Forest, King River, Ovens River, Glenrowan, Yielima Station, Barmah Forest, Yarrawonga, Echuca, Nathalia, Barmah Lake, Wodonga, Oxley, Docker, Wangaratta, Fifteen Mile Creek, Mokoan, Hume Weir, Mulwala Weir, Namoi River, Lake Cargelligo, Broken River, Rose River, Lake Buffalo, Goulbourn River, Upper Murrumbidgee River, Warby Ranges, Swan Hill, Moira Station, LaTrobe Valley, Charlton.\r\n\r\nMentioned: silver bream, mountain galaxias, cormorant, worms, Bardi Grubs, platypus, water rat, white mussel, black mussel, swan, mice, tiger snakes, frog, foxes, cats, pigs, rabbits.\r\n\r\nPlant life mentioned: Red gum, willows, bottlebrush. blackboys, tobacco, cotton, St. John's Wort, blackberries, grey box, kabungi, water hyacinths, blue gum.\r\n\r\nAlso mentioned: Flemington; Barmah Muster; River Improvement Trust; Department of Sustainability and Environment; Rex Hunt; Erni Briggs; Charlie Carp; the huge influx of silver perch in either 1954 or 1957; the changing structure of the river influenced by the removal of snags and willows."

        "Richard Kennedy is an Aboriginal man residing in Wodonga, Victoria. Born in 1959, Richard grew up on the Lachlan River in central New South Wales with his family and currently works with the Catchment Management Authority (CMA) in the Wodonga area.\r\n\r\nIn the interview, Richard discusses his life growing up around the river with his family and how it was a central part of his life. He tells of his cultural connection with the land and the need to maintain and pass on that connection and knowledge; something that is being done through his CMA work with Aboriginal men. He says that Aboriginal people are losing their connections to Country and culture where colonisation played a pivotal role. He notes that his situation is not helped by the declining health of the land and rivers that he says have been affected by introduced fish and plant species such as the European carp and willow trees. \r\n\r\nRichard also speaks extensively about floods and how withholding the water impacts on the nature of the land as a floodplain; the types of fish, animals and plant life that are present; and his work in conservation, largely influenced by the sustainable practices embedded within his Aboriginal culture.\r\n\r\nRichard also mentions also where he has found Trout Cod: Murrumbidgee, Murray River, Yarrawonga, Old Man Creek, Hay.\r\n\r\nAlso mentioned: Worms, Rabbits, Fish, Kangaroos, Emus. Possums. Antechinuses. Barking owl, Sugar Gliders. Platypus. Willows. Blackberry. Osage Orange. Briar Rose. Patterson’s Curse. Scotch Thistle.\r\n"

        "An interview in five parts with Dennis Lean.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1943, Dennis Lean is a third generation shop owner in Yarrawonga. His grandfather came to the area in 1917 and opened a barber shop. The shop was predominantly for hairdressing, but Dennis's father started selling fishing tackle and other items. Dennis expanded this aspect of the business, both as a result of his own interest in recreational fishing, and due to the increase in fishing related tourism. Dennis was also president of the Cobram Fowl and Game Club.\r\n\r\nDennis talks about: learning to fish on Lake Mulwala; fishing methods; different types of boats; draining of the lake for weir maintenance; movement of Murray Cod and Yellowbelly; fish preservation; relationship between Ovens River, Murray River, and Hume Weir; siltation in the Ovens River; displacement of Catfish by European Carp; a virus carried by European Carp; important differences between silver and black species of Willow tree; impact of Willow removal on platypus.\r\n\r\nOther fish mentioned: 'silver bream' (species unspecified)."

He has strong ties with the area with his father also from Narrabri and his mother from nearby Wee Waa (NSW).\r\n\r\nIn this interview Spider discusses his childhood and youth around the Namoi River and also how the onset of maturity saw his views change toward the river to those of conservation and sustainability. He talks about his involvement with the fishing club and how they have been working for the past 25 years on the river. He discusses the fishing restrictions placed upon fishers, restocking efforts, fish feeding habits, the changes of the fish population and the predatory and cannibal nature of the Murray Cod. \r\n\r\nMentioned: Turtle, bream, trout, sparrow, starling, willow tree, azolla.

It was during his life on the property where he learned how to fish from his father, whom he considered to be a good fisherman. Life in the region saw his free time being spent by the river, or camping with friends along the Barwon river. \r\n\r\nOf the issues facing the Namoi, Darcy feels that silting is a major problem that is contributing to the drying of waterholes. After silting he believes that carp may have also contributed to the declining fish populations.\r\n\r\nMentioned:\r\nFig trees, clover hay, red river gums, crickets, platypuses, native water rats, ducks, swans, brolgas, red-belly black snakes."

He also discusses: the impact of irrigation on water levels, fish migration and breeding; translocating Catfish into dams and the hardiness of the species; a 'red carp' and 'mirror carp' species, the latter with large scales."

        "An interview in  six parts.\r\n\r\nPearl and Joe Trindall are an Indigenous couple who have lived in the Namoi region for most their lives. Pearl was born in Boomi, while Joe was born in Narrabri and they both, along with their children, have spent a lot of time travelling around Australia droving. \r\n\r\nPearl and Joe talk at length about a number of topics including growing up on the river and how it was central to their lives - it was a source of food, meeting and socialising, as well as a means for passing on Indigenous knowledges by the Elders. The Elders told the younger generation that they were to practice sustainable fishing and were only to take what they needed. The Elders also taught language and spirituality, told stories and were respected members of their community.\r\n\r\nPearl and Joe also speak about the changes in the region they have witnessed. They both say that the pollution from cotton farming has had the greatest impact on the deteriorating health of the river, compared to when they were younger when the water was clean enough to drink. They also mention the impacts that the installation of weirs and dams have had.\r\n\r\nMentioned: carp impacts, and 1956 floods.\r\n\r\nAnimals mentioned: Worms, gudgeon, goanna (neebie), black snake."

He speaks about taking on the responsibilities of an older child by being a provider and catching fish for his single mother and his family. He also shared his catches with other families and relatives; the act of which is common within Indigenous cultures that highlights the importance of family and kinship structures, while also promoting sustainability.\r\n\r\nRobert also speaks of being taught how to catch fish and find yabbies in the most inconspicuous places. He also outlines the changes that he has noticed in the river regarding the cotton industry, the far reaching impacts of European carp, the history of the area, and fish tagging. \r\n\r\n"

        "An interview with Fay and Donald Cooney. Fay and Donald were born in Cunnumulla in the 1930s, and have lived most of their lives on the Paroo River at Eulo on family sheep properties ‘Turn Turn’ and ‘Goonamurra’, going back to the 1900s. Both talk about their connection with the river systems and how the rivers connect communities. Fay recalls growing up with local Aboriginal kids in Eulo, and Donald discusses a book he wrote about the history of animal stock bells.\r\n\r\nFay and Donald talk about: the impact of floods at Eulo prior to the bridge; a time before motorised transportation and telephone communications; the ‘flood truck’ which used to transport goods and people across flood waters; the river as a place of recreation for children and a stock route for graziers; swimming, playing, and yabbying with Aboriginal children; Donald’s father’s recollection of Aboriginal corroborees that took place at water holes at Caiwarro and Tilbaroo; the introduction of European Carp; how bore drains reduced the amount of stock along the river; bushfires in the 1950s; impact of feral cats on water rats and bird species; Paroo as the ‘last river going west that had the Murray cod’; being able to predict a flood’s size by the sound of frogs."

        "Cousins, Ron Heinemann and Ron Gardiner, talk separately about their memories of growing up on the Paroo River. Both men owned properties along the river and were fishers. Ron Heinemann was an especially keen fisher and has an intimate knowledge of the changes that the system has undergone. \r\n\r\nFirst interview with Ron Heinemann, in three parts.\r\n\r\nRon Heinemann was born in 1922, and grew up on a sheep property in Springvale, west of Eulo, on the Paroo River. Ron’s parents moved to the area in the 1920s. He was taught to fish by his mother and cousins’ family.\r\n\r\nRon Heinemann talks about: 1942 and 1964 floods; Aboriginal knowledge of vegetation and floods; a black flood in 1935 which killed fish in the local water holes; how fish spawn before they die (before a flood); kangaroo and emu shooting; the 'diaries of Caiwarro Currawinyahere', written 1860-1950s, from a sheep and cattle property; siltation in Warrego River; restocking Warrego River with Murray Cod fingerlings in 1985; artesian water and basin; introduction of European Carp 1950s (originally brought to clean irrigation channels); bird life.\r\n\r\nMentions 'grunter' fish, however species unspecified. Also mention of: Cane grass, Mitchell grass, Flinders grass, Yapunyah tree, Hyacinth, Duck weed, Didgee tree, Lucerne.",
        "Second interview with Ron Gardiner, in two parts.\r\n\r\nRon Gardiner, the cousin of Ron Heinemann, was born in 1918 in Cunnamulla. Ron learned to swim in the Paroo River. In 1980 Ron moved from Paroo to Clifton, on the Condamine River.\r\n\r\nRon Gardiner talks about: history of the Eulo bridge, built in 1928; history of families and people in the area; abundance of Yellowbelly fish at Caiwarro; black flood at Five Mile hole; abundance of crayfish yabby and shrimp post-flood; saving sheep stock; two times the Paroo River reached the Darling; how vegetation requires rain to survive after a flood to remove silt; salty and freshwater bores; mud springs in Eulo; introduction of European Carp; concerns about irrigation; the relationship between the Warrego and Paroo Rivers."

In spite of this, Tud remains rather upbeat about the condition of the river adding that silting is a natural and inevitable process. Tud also tells of his culture including the hunting techniques used to lure and catch native Australian animals and the friendships between the Aboriginal Nations of the Paroo and the Warrego Rivers.\r\n"

        "An interview in five parts with Adrian Brown.\r\n\r\nAdrian talks about growing up along the River (around Queanbeyan River, Jumping Creek, and Wanna Wanna Creek)  and the way that he and his brother learnt the land by walking it and fishing the river with their Dad. He talks about historical sites and significant sites; expressing continuity with Country; making Coolamons; the significance of Country; traditional ceremony; initiation rites; right of passage; the duty of care for different animals as part of an interconnected environment; and recognising law and responsibility for Country. He also discusses the interaction and movements of peoples along the catchment (relaying the history of the Ngunawal and their responsibility to the Murrumbidgee corridor and their relation to coastal peoples); trading; and shared vocabulary across language groups from the top of the Murrumbidgee to Lakes Entrance.\r\n\r\nAdrian covers the effects of housing developments on cultural practice; weeds; variance in fish population according to river flow; lighting fires; cultural burns; site management; discrimination; ignorance; and work with the ACT government to promote the recognition and understanding  of Indigenous Australian interests.\r\n\r\nAdrian also shares his experience as an Aboriginal Liaison Officer with the ACT National Parks and Wildlife Service and his sense of pride and belonging. He talks about efforts to refocus the connection to Country of Indigenous Australians employed as rangers, and to promote a cultural mindfulness among them. He speculates how Indigenous people could again be welcomed by the Ngunawal as National Parks officers - all learning and walking the land together.\r\n\r\nAdrian discusses how fish travel up the river when it floods; mixing traditional and modern fishing methods; sources of sediment (sand from Tharwa, dirt from Cooma, Bredbo and Numeralla Rivers); clay baking fish; mussels (saltwater and freshwater); abalone; native plants.\r\n"

        "An interview in four parts with Bryan Pratt.\r\n\r\nBrian came to the Murrumbidgee in 1965. He talks about seasonal variations in the prevalence of fish, and their breeding and migration habits. He remarks on regional variations within species and cross-breeding (e.g. how the Clarence River Cod differs from the \"Fitzroy Cod\"). He discusses the annual mass death of Silver Perch and Murray Cod, speculating that its cause is a pathogenic. He also speaks about population decline, and weighing the social and ecological consequences of translocating and re-stocking fish. He offers a strong endorsement of the Native Fish Strategy and talks about his efforts to advocate for native fish in the media.\r\n\r\nHe shares his knowledge of lures; their colour, size and patterning, as well as other ways that their design replicates nature. He also talks about bait; what it's used for, where it comes from, and how it's collected.\r\n\r\nMention of Fitzroy Cod, Brook Trout, Atlantic Salmon, Nile Perch, Barrumundi, Midget Barrumundi, mussels, scrub worms, bardy grub, witchetty grub, wood grub (variant?), yabby, squid, pilchards, prawn, beach worms, abalone, EHN Virus, pathogens, Lernaea (parasite)\r\n\r\n",
        "Current owner of a fishing and tackle shop in Belconnen. But this is only a retirement enterprise. He started life as a scientist, but was lured to the public service firstly by Gough Whitlam. When the Whitlam government fell- he went to work for the territories conservation department and so was an early cross over of science and bureaucrat. But all the time he was an avid recreational fisherman. He has been a long time advocate of building bridges between science and recreational fishing and strongly believes that mass communication is the way to go. He has written for popular Rec fishing magazines  and newspapers for decades. He also has a regular spot on radio. He sees the tackle shop as a type of liminal space where he can translate science for fishers and gather information and knowledge from fishers for science. I think that Bryan's interview has lots of gems - but the section that I particularly liked was when he and I went over to the lures and he talked to me about how they work; their design and the ways that they replicate nature. He gives very strong endorsements of the Native Fish Strategy.  \r\n"

        "An interview in two parts with Keith Coleman and Max Jeffrey.\r\n\r\nKeith grew up in Brewarrina and learned to fish with his father. He learned to swim in the river, and remembers how clear the water was - clear enough that people could go spearfishing. \r\n\r\nKeith and Max talk about using worms, mussels and crayfish as bait and discuss variance in carp populations over time. They  also observe that fishing is better in the dry when the water levels are lower. They mention Yellowbelly and Murray Cod restocking programs; talk about de-oxygenated water; changes in attitudes about sustainable fishing (catch and release); how to read the river; what they've learned from Indigenous Australians; the mass of birdlife; weir management; and water restrictions. They talk about boat trips along the river and their sighting of baby catfish in the Bokhara and Culgoa Rivers.\r\n\r\nMention of Goanna, Wallaby. frogs, blacksnakes, brown snakes, carpet snakes, mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nMention of Brewarrina fishing club"

He talks about the history of fishing in the area; professional anglers and netters; and changing attitudes towards fishing (catch and release). He learned to fish with nets and lines with his grandfathers. He discusses the arrival of European carp in 1973, noting that they travel in floodwater. He talks about bait, what it takes to catch Bony Beam, and set lines.\r\n\r\nBarb talks about yabbying, and says that she likes fishing but loves the river.\r\n\r\nMick and Barb approve of restocking efforts by the Department of Primary Industries (DPI), but share their concerns about the reduced responsiveness of fishing inspectors. They observe that there are more visitors and anglers about the river and note that illegal fishing is still practiced. They discuss man made weirs and natural weirs; river management; water allocations; water licenses; grazing along the river: erosion; and efforts to re-establish vegetation along the river.\r\n\r\nMention of NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI), Catchment Management Authority (CMA)\r\nPenny Wong\r\n\r\nMention of Lake Cargellico (NSW), Burrendong Dam (NSW), Darling River Weir 19A (30°13'55.0\"S 145°41'49.0\"E; MDBA Site ID 425037; \"19-mile weir\")\r\n\r\nMention of water lizards, wombats, shrimp.",

        "Feli McHughes is a Ngemba man from the Upper Darling region of Brewarrina. His passion about the Brewarrina Ngemba Billabong and the wider river system has seen him involved in a number of projects with numerous organisations. His visions for the environment are intertwined with the Aboriginal cultural and environmental values that he holds, and his personal views explore further the wider social issues facing Aboriginal people today.\r\n\r\nFeli believes that the root of social issues facing Aboriginal people is the lack of culturally appropriate employment. He reflects on his personal experiences where he recalls having to adopt another identity and therefore understands the difficulties this entails. He says that Aboriginal people as instinctive custodians possess valuable skills that are transferable to specialised areas of employment. \r\n\r\nFeli’s vision for billabongs, that he says are the antibiotics for the damaged systems, include the revegetation of native bush tucker and restocking the waters with native fingerlings. He is working with scientists from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Industry & Investment (now Department of Trade and Investment), and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) to help realise these goals. \r\n\r\nFeli also discusses the Native Fish Strategy for the Murray-Darling Basin (2003-2013) and the Indigenous Protected Areas (IPA) in which these billabongs are located."

        "An interview in three parts with Phillip Parnaby.\r\n\r\nPhillip has lived in Bourke his entire life and in this interview he talks about his experience fishing while growing up in a family of eight, when fish were a large part of their diet. He explains his relationship with the river, his family history, his Indigenous Australian heritage, and how fishing and sharing go together. He talks about swimming in the weir, setting lines, using spinners, teaching his kids to fish. He mentions yabbying at Wearrego and Cuttaburra, and explains how yabbies were used as a Chinese aphrodisiac. He discusses different baits: Silver Carp, Kangaroo, Emu, worms, sand worms, Bardi Grubs, tinned tuna, mussels, and yabbies). He explains the differrence between drop nets and overnight nets, and discusses the conditions that are good for Yabby catching. He talks about the river when it dries; salt springs; algae; water allocations; river management; and weir management. He also talks about the future of Bourke and people leaving town, and his involvement with the program Australian Story - Out of the Dust.\r\n\r\nPhillip is an entrepreneur and is the owner of the Back O' Bourke Motel, rental accommodation, and he has just purchased the local RSL club and the Memorial Hall - which he wants to redevelop into a Tavern style place to cater to the tourists that come through in the winter. He explains that there are only two eateries in town at present - Port Of Bourke Hotel and Chinese in the local bowling club. \r\n\r\nMention of Silver carp (\"forky tails\"), Bardi Grubs, worms, sand worms, Kurrajong Trees, Gum trees, algae and Bourke Weir."

        "Phillip Sullivan grew up on the Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission in the 1960s with his immediate and extended family. For Phillip, life on the river as a Ngemba man revolved around the Barwon River with fishing and swimming being favourite pastimes for the entire family. \r\n\r\nPhillip passionately discusses a wide range of topics that include growing up along the river; the impacts on the Upper Darling and surrounds caused by weirs and restrictions; Aboriginal history; the significance of connection to Country and water; Aboriginal law and personal responsibilities; and the relationships between neighbouring Aboriginal nations. He also points out the cultural shifts he has witnessed; from that of a group-focused, collectivist culture, to a more  Western-aligned culture of individualism with its self-focused culture, and its consequences on Aboriginal kinship values, society and the environment. \r\n\r\nMention of: King Brown Snake. Eastern Brown Snake. Long neck turtles.\r\n\r\nQuandong. Gum trees. Coolabah trees. Spinifex."

        "An interview in three parts with Geoff Brennan. \r\n\r\nGeoff was a construction contractor but has been working with water management for twenty years. He talks about his understanding of the cross over from recreational fishing to management of water, and about Lake Makoan being decommmisioned 2009.\r\n\r\nGeoff grew up on the Broken River. He shares his earliest memories of learning to fish with his father and sister; camping on the Murray River; his desire to pass on a sense of ownership of the rivers to his children and grandchildren; what to look for in the river when fishing for trout and Macquarie Perch; fly fishing; which parts of a snag different fish prefer; lake fishing compared to river fishing; fish behaviour depending on temperature and time of day; and what he likes about fishing. He discusses the benefits of fresh bait; where to collect scrub worms; catching yabbies; attracting shrimp with orange peel; decline of Catfish; changes to the Broken Rivers structure (de-snagging programs, the construction of the Nillahcootie 1967, the floods of 1974); fish migration and fishways; changes in fishing technology; the opening cermemony of Lake Nillahcootie;  the changes in water quality due to the introduction of Carp; the Broken River Irrigators and their advocacy that a dam be build on the Broken River; the dams effect on the local ecology; Lake Mokoan water turbidity; and how the Broken River earnt its name. He goes on to discuss community engagement and the future of the River. \r\n\r\nMention of \"Barragunda\" a place at the head of the Broken River (Vic), \"Green Swamp\" or \"Green Wetlands\" near Winton Wetlands (VIC).\r\n\r\nMention of scrub worms, mud eyes, black crickets, grasshoppers, bardie grubs, shrimp, yabbies\r\n\r\nMention of Sedges, ribbon weed"

        "An interview in four parts with Raymond Donald and John McKenzie.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1926, Raymond Donald was a technician at the Snobs Creek Hatchery for thirty-five years. During fieldwork trips, which could last for several weeks, not only did Raymond set nets, angle for brood stock, and process fish, but he also ensured camp life on trips went well. Renowned as a great camp cook, teams would catch game to supplement the provisions they carried with them.\r\n\r\nRaymond talks about: growing up in Eildon and living at Rhonda on the Goulburn River; working on the Goulburn River from the headwaters to the Murray; working on Trout Cod at Snobs Creek Hatchery; finding diseases in fish species; stations at Yarrawonga, Echuca, Mildura, where they trapped fish; being the first in Australia to artificially breed Macquarie Perch; migration of fish from Lake Eildon to Jamieson, Goulburn; water temperatures and spawning; plankton surveys in billabongs and flooded rivers; days before radio transmitters, tagging and tracking over twelve-hundred Golden Perch; the effect of 1956 and 1958 floods on fish species; camping and cooking bush tucker on field trips; translocating Murray cod from Lake Charlegrark; impact of European Carp on Catfish, 1970s. \r\n\r\nBorn 1947, John McKenzie initially worked at Fisheries and Wildlife, and then Freshwater Fisheries on the Murray. He was involved in early development of radio tracking, and was involved in fieldwork with Snobs Creek Hatchery.\r\n \r\nJohn talks about: his work with Fisheries and Wildlife, and Freshwater Fisheries on the Murray; sampling fish for growth rates, age, stomach content; tagging and tracking native fish with radio transmitters; work with Arthur Rylah Institute; techniques and chemicals used to catch/sample fish; coexistence of Redfin and Catfish species; disconnection of billabongs from rivers; and electrofishing revolutionising sampling.\r\n\r\nOther fish mentioned (species unspecified): galaxias, grayling.\r\n"

        "An interview in four parts with J.O. Langtry.\r\n\r\nJ.O. Langtry talks about his investigation into the ecology of the Murray-Darling System with the newly formed State Fisheries and Game Department of Victoria. His systematic examination of native fisheries, informed by collaborating with professional fisherman, is central to our understanding of the Murray-Darling ecosystem. He discusses the anabranch system; drainage zones; opportunistic farming; pelagic fish; hatching Murray Cod at Burraby Station; fish stomach contents and diet; his influence on early fishing regulations; and legal and illegal fishing methods.\r\n\r\nHe also talks about the people who assisted him in his surveys; the various river conditions that different fish prefer; and the cultural and recreational value of fisheries. He discusses ground water; rising water tables; salinity; water and land management; and the 'Landline' TV series. He argues that efforts to restore the Coorong and Lower Lakes are not worthwhile. \r\n\r\nHe goes on to talk about the wide variety of people and occupations he dealt with in his work; the differences between Murray Cod and Trout Cod; a plan to remove Bony Bream that was later abandoned; fish farming; fish stocking; local and visiting poachers; and commercial fish markets. He discusses his service in the Australian Army Research Group, and his work to develop rations in Korea, New Guinea and Malaysia. He comments on the demographic of the Victorian public service and ends by reiterating the diminished scale of the anabranch system. \r\n\r\nOther fish species mentioned: lungfish, trout fish/eastern big belly.\r\n\r\nMention of: Victorian State Fisheries and Game Department, Melbourne University, CSIRO, National Water Board, Rotary Club, Murray Darling Basin Authority."

        "John Baulch: taught himself how to fish as a child with an Alvey sidecast fishing reel. He talks about flow rates; water levels; the European Carp supplanting the Redfin; the decline of Yellowbelly; selling fish to the local clubs; and the return of native fish.\r\n\r\nGreg McNeil:, an irrigator, suggests that recent floods might have made unecessary plans to re-snag and reclaim the river. He advocates for a hands-off approach to river management and says that irrigation across the basin has matured while becoming more 'intense'.\r\n\r\nUnannounced: recalls professional fishermen; swimming in the river; and observes that there was less recreational fishing in the past. Remembers that the Loddon was different when backed up by a weir from 1923 to 1964 and also talks about water levels and the river's improved health more recently.\r\n\r\nRodger Reilly: remembers fishing with his uncle. Mention of Woods Point. Worked with Fisheries and Wildlife, transferred to the Lands Department, and ended up in Kerang. He talks about needing to change where he goes angling because of the poor quality of water (caused by Cumbungi, siltation); frontage licenses and the advantage of local knowledge.\r\n\r\nEsther Kirby; (of the Baraba Baraba people) used to fish at the weir with her brother sister and partner, catching Redfin and Yabbies and sharing the spoils. She talks about the decline in fish diversity (especially catfish) with arrival of Carp; and how she learnt a technique to call fish up from one of her Aunties. She has fished the Edwards, Wakool, Niemur, and Goulburn rivers, among others.\r\n\r\nElaine Jones; learnt to fish for Flounder on the coast and only later stared fishing on the Loddon. She discusses the 1973 flood and the arrival of European Carp; the disappearance of Tortoises; irrigation, water efficiency and the salinity problem.\r\n\r\nRoss Stanton: remembers fishing for Redfin out of Gunbower Creek. and talks about schools of small Carp. \r\n\r\nRob O'Brien: learnt to fish with his Uncle in the lower Kerang. catching Yabbies with \"roly-poly\" woodlice. He talks about the colour of the water; fishing with spinners; and recalls that people used to fill half a wheat bag with Redfin dragging a spinner while walking from the old Kerang bridge to Kerang. He mentions the arrival of Carp in 1974; swimming; siltation; and using drum nets.\r\n\r\nThe group goes on to discuss  the return of Murray Cod; the use of Murray Cod to control Carp; size limits; catch and release; changing attitudes; competitive fishing; blackwater (in 1986); different species of trout cod; and fish lanes.\r\n\r\nEsther mentions that the (Wadi Wadi?, Wodi Wodi?) group met with Parks and Wildlife and the Water Catchment Authority to raise the issue of fish being killed by irrigation.\r\n\r\nMention of Murray Darling Freshwater Research Centre;  \"Water Catchment Authority\"; \"Fisheries and Wildlife\"; \"Lands Department\"\r\n\r\nAlso mentions: Red Azolla (Azolla filiculoides); Myriophyllum (\"watermilfoil\", \"cat tail\"); Cumbungi (Typha latifolia)."

He shares stories about the professional fisherman who used to fish the Murray; illegal fishing; and talks about electric motors; trolling for cod and Callop; fishing from cliffs and catching Cod and Catfish. He also discusses the advent of lure fishing in the area; what he looks for in a lure (the right action, the right size and then colour); the reasons why fishing gets better when the water's low; and competitive fishing with the Lower Murray Lure Fishing Club. He notes that the popularity of lure fishing in the area contributed to the closing of the Cod season for a couple of years. He talks about water skiing; the floods of 1974/75; yabbying; proper fish handling; his fish 'finder' or fish 'sounder'; and shares what he likes about fishing.\r\n"

        "Dr Virginia Marshall's 2014 doctoral thesis is a recommended resource for researchers of water rights, particularly those of indigenous peoples. Marshall notes that an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) perspective on water differs fundamentally from the way that water has been constituted in Australian national water reforms as separable from land and governed by property rights.\n<p>By contrast, ATSI peoples do not see water and land as separate; for example, the ocean is regarded as a part of country or ‘sea-country’. Water is particularly significant to Aboriginal cultural identity, for example, people are characterized as 'saltwater-people', 'fresh-water people' or 'bitter-water people'.</p>\n<p>Marshall surveys a wide range of policy documents and legal instruments and finds little to prevent the 'unfettered discretion' of bureaucracy or to support the water rights of Indigenous Peoples conferred in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (Articles 25 and 26).</p>\n<p>She also notes the absence of a water ethics discourse or social and environmental risk management framework (such as the Equator Principles) to address responsibility for risks such as water systems contamination, rates of water extraction or intergenerational social responsibilities. She makes several recommendations to address the situation.</p>"

        "The interviewee, in semi-retirement, moved from Sydney’s coast to Moruya on the far south coast to remain by the sea. He has fond memories of growing up on Sydney’s coast, learning to swim at beaches, in rock pools, and learning to surf.\r\n\r\nHe has an intimate knowledge of coastal dynamics from his experience as a surfer, and postgraduate research in coastal dynamics and processes. He loves surfing for its relaxation and its physical challenges. He reflects on what he has learned from surfing, being able to read the ocean, waves, tides and winds. Being a surfer has given him an intimate understanding of the environment, informing his research on coastal processes such as wave and rip modelling.\r\n\r\nThe interviewee accepts the inevitability of coastal development, and suggests that it is possible to move forward as long as communities are kept out of hazardous areas that are prone to floods and erosion. Environmental processes need to be understood. For example, in New South Wales, headlands are left undeveloped, and houses are hidden behind foredunes. Coastal development should be ‘nodalised’ near services, not spread along the coast. A reference is made to the NSW Coastal Policy.\r\n\r\nHe surveys local beaches once a month, and notes the environmental impact (generally) of visitors from Canberra, and weekenders. Jet skis used for recreation are a pest, creating noise and air pollution, but are also useful for research and rescue purposes. He comments positively about marine park exemptions that allow fishing off shores and rocks, and feels the controls are sufficient with bag and size limits in place. He notes more people fish from boats, but overall there is a small population of fishers.\r\n\r\nThe interviewee is concerned that while local government recognise the value of coast to the local community, state and federal government do not. In order to respond to issues such as rising sea levels, funding is required at that level in order to sustain coastal management into the future.\r\n"

        "The interviewee moved to the far south coast primarily for lifestyle reasons – ‘we just liked the kind of laid-back, small country town feel’. He grew up in Port Stephens, Newcastle and has lived in Canberra as well, so is familiar with the south coast area. When living in Newcastle he was active in the local surf club, and continues his involvement with the local surf club in a clerical capacity.\r\n\r\nThroughout his life he has enjoyed ocean-based sporting activities such as snorkelling, spear fishing, swimming, and kayaking. He continues to engage in these activities, spending a couple of times a week at the beach, with the surf club, and comments on the positive social aspect/value of these activities.\r\n\r\nHe discusses the coastal environment of Port Stephens, changes since 1950s, and talks about his son’s work as a marine biologist in the area, studying environmental impacts such as tourist boats, on dolphins.\r\n\r\nMarine protected areas and sanctuary zones on the far south coast are discussed, in particular Burrewarra Point, which the interviewee has known since the 1970s, before it became a marine park. He vigorously supports marine protected areas and laments the lack of political will to enforce sanctuary zones. Personally, he is prepared to pay in economic terms for protective environmental measures. On the south coast he has observed illegal activities such as abalone poaching, and comments on the rubbish recreational and professional fisherman leave behind. His biggest concerns however are government complacency, and issues such as silt running down from the river and occasional raw sewage overflows."

        "The interviewee has a wide background spanning food technology, captive animal management, education, and has worked with NSW Fisheries, looking after Black Cod in captivity. For the last thirty years he has scuba dived and snorkelled, spear fishing on a weekly basis, supplementing his family’s diet with fish and crayfish.\r\n\r\nOriginally from Sydney, he moved to the far south coast for its affordability. He and his partner also wanted to live near the water. His partner swims and snorkels at the beach; he notes the social aspect of these recreational activities for family, friends, and children.\r\n\r\nThe interviewee monitors seasonal changes and migration patterns of crayfish, in monthly moon cycles. He has observed an increase in crayfish populations, crediting regulations implemented by fisheries in the late 1990s, rather than marine parks. While he supports marine parks, he feels that selective exemptions in sanctuary zones, such as shore-based fishing, results in their ineffectiveness due to people taking advantage. He has observed a polarisation in the community with respect to marine parks, and feels that more education is required, as well as concerted coordination between Fisheries, Marine Parks, and Local Government Areas in order to have better outcomes for everyone in the community. For instance, marine environments cannot be considered in isolation – they are impacted upon by terrestrial, land-based development, hence the need for holistic governance. He mentions the Murray Darling Basin Plan consultation as an example of community ‘disengagement’."

        "The interviewee retired to the far south coast in 2003. He recalls visiting the area in the 1960s during school holidays with his brother, learning to surf together. He enjoys the beach, running on the beach, surfing, the hinterland, and community. One of his hobbies is photography, including aerial photography of the coastline.\r\n\r\nThe interviewee has extensive experience in environmental, conservation and government organisations, having worked nationally in National Parks and Environment. He is a supporter of marine parks and thinks that sanctuary zones should be enforced (i.e. exemptions not allowed) in order to give fish stocks a chance to build up. He would like to see the continuation of sanctuary zones.\r\n\r\nAlthough surfing is a solo activity, he likes the social aspect of going down to the beach, assessing surf conditions before going out to surf. He talks about the beautiful views of land from the ocean, and the way in which surfing educates you about the weather and tides.\r\n\r\nHe reflects on the lack of major development as a reason for good water quality in the region, and finds the greatest irritant to be recreational jet skiers due to the noise and smell (fumes) of the craft. He would like to see restrictions on jet ski activities. "

        "The interviewee has lived and worked on the far south coast for the last eight years. Originally from central Victoria, his parents bought a holiday home in the area when he was as a child. Now he runs a small water-based tourist business with his wife seven months of the year.\r\n\r\nHis father was drawn to the area for its recreational fishing, and the interviewee ‘grew up as a mad fisherman’, fishing from both the shore and boat. He has taught his children to fish, and recalls fond memories growing up with his brother, snorkelling and spear fishing.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the tourist business, he enjoys the interactive experiences he is able to offer customers, such as watching South Coast stingrays and water birds feeding on fish. Out in the kayaks his experiences are generally positive; kayakers are able to move about freely and interact with local commercial fishermen, who are happy to engage and educate. There are negative experiences as well, including poaching or illegal fishing in sanctuary zones. Jet skis are a problem; they are noisy and reduce the enjoyment of kayakers.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about the amnesty or allowance of shore fishing in sanctuary zones, he raises concern about the confusion it causes between ‘ocean-fronted’ and other sanctuary zones. He believes more resources should be placed into educating the public so that recreational fishing and tourism can still bring economic value to the region, in an environmentally sustainable way."

        "The interviewee has lived on the coast all his life, and for five generations in Moreton Bay (Queensland). He has also spent thirty-five years engaging with all levels of government and coastal communities about environmental conservation and protection.\r\n\r\nIn terms of valuing the coast, he discusses the medicinal, therapeutic, and spiritual aspects of beaches, referring to them as a place of reflection. He also reflects on the beach as a place of love, romance, and emotive experiences, often referring to the 1981 Australian surfing movie Puberty Blues – and the accessibility of beaches to all walks of life.\r\n\r\nHe talks about the changes in perceptions and cultures related to the beach. For example, a ‘surfer’ includes anyone who engages in the surf zone, not just those with surfboards. He discusses the beginning of the surf club movement in the 1900s and how surfing was popularised by America in the 1950s; the changing culture and perception of surfers as irresponsible types to political advocates – now active in Surf Councils and National Surf Reserves. He also describes the role of National Surf Reserves in conservation and preservation, and refers to Crescent Head and the Dunghutti Aboriginal peoples.\r\n\r\nWhile the interviewee agrees with no-take zones, the idea or need for fishing licences offend him. He talks about different types of fisherman and the need for governments to be aware of the different user groups, communicating and educating accordingly.\r\n\r\nHe also discusses communities and their strong sense of ownership over their beaches and subsequent management. He thinks that the government’s biggest challenge is in their approach to community liaison and stakeholder engagement. When governments interfere it impacts peoples’ spiritual and social connections, and their experiences become diminished. He worries about community capacity to change the way governments act towards them.\r\n\r\nHe has a deep understanding of subcultures and discusses the differences between surf lifesavers ('clubbies') and surfers ('hard core'). He often refers to the ‘bromance’ that exists in male surf culture – a connectedness between males and a way for blokes to find a space away from other things in their lives. Reflecting on his work with Suicide Prevention Australia and Australian Men’s Shed Association (mental health initiatives), he talks about male culture in general, the way that men connect and bond through activities, and the power for these activities to cross cultural boundaries. He also makes a clear distinction between surfer and fisherman communities, noting that when the surf is bad a surfer will go home rather than participate in another beach activity. Similarly, a fisherman will do the same.\r\n\r\nHe recognises the balance between economic stimulus and protection of headlands, and having worked as a federal government advisor, environmental advocate, and lobbyist, feels frustrated and ‘burned out’ when it comes to ever-changing government agendas at the expense of the environment (e.g. coal export terminals in the Great Barrier Reef).\r\n\r\nFinally, when asked about the allowance of fishing off beaches and headlands in sanctuary zones he comments about the waste he has personally observed on commercial fishing boats and trawlers.\r\n"

        "Aboriginal fish traps are made with rocks or small boulders that have been placed strategically in a flowing waterway that forms a trap. The arrangement allows the flow of water to pass through, with an opening large enough for a fish or other aquatic life to be caught inside but not escape.\r\n\r\nThe most notable of these fish traps are the National Heritage listed Ngunnhu (Baiame's Ngunnhu) of the Ngemba people in Brewarrina, New South Wales. The Ngunnhu were a gift from Baiame (The Creator) whom entrusted the Ngemba people to be the custodians. The Ngunnhu were also used by neighbouring Nations where the site also became an important place for meetings, ceremonies and trade. \r\n\r\n"

        "Blackwater is oxygen-depleted water caused by the decay of organic matter. The decay process darkens the water and the oxygen in the water is consumed, sometimes at a rate faster than it can be replenished. This can result in a low level of dissolved oxygen that may cause stress to fish, crayfish and other aquatic animals. When the dissolved oxygen reaches a very low level it can result in fish deaths (Murray Darling Basin Authority, n.d.).\r\n\r\nBlackwater occurs naturally during flooding events in the Murray Darling Basin, and, despite it's harmful effect in the short term, can contribute to overall improvements in its ecosystems. This is because the breakdown of organic matter releases carbon and other nutrients into the system, boosting zooplankton and macroinvertebrate communities, in turn acting as food sources for fish, plants and other organisms.

An array of pressures ranging from the over allocation of water resources, poor land management planning and the expansion of primary production have all contributed to declines in river health. Fish and their habitats have been greatly affected by these pressures, with estimates suggesting native fish populations are at 10% of pre-European colonisation levels.</p>\n<p>As all levels of government explore options for improving the health of the Murray-Darling Basin, the knowledge held by people within the community who have had a lengthy association with the waterways of the Basin is being increasingly recognised as a valuable resource. People’s lived experience provides a unique insight into how changes in rivers and their associated habitats have occurred over time. Accessing and recording this information will make a significant contribution to our knowledge of the Murray-Darling Basin, and help shape the management decisions of the future to achieve improved river health outcomes.</p>\n<p>Many different groups of people have developed unique relationships with rivers and their associated environments. The long history of recreational fishing within the Basin has led generations of people to spend substantial amounts of time on or near its rivers. Their desire to experience the river and to catch fish has developed a refined understanding of how fish relate to the riverine environment, and consequently how the changes to these environments have affected the status of native fisheries.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Indigenous peoples have relationships with the rivers that stretch back tens of thousands of years before the arrival of European colonisers. This strong and lasting association has also allowed Indigenous peoples to witness contemporary changes to the health of the Basin’s rivers and observe how these changes have influenced fish and their habitats. In addition, landholders, long-time residents, regular tourists and an array of other community stakeholders hold stories and memories of the river that are an invaluable resource for guiding its future management.</p>\n<p>The project represents a unique collaboration between some of Australia’s most prominent ecological oral historians (both within tertiary institutions and commercial production companies), all four Basin-state fisheries agencies and regional NRM organisations. The integration of research institutions, government and local community stakeholders provides a diverse and flexible framework to access a wide range of participants and ensure the collection, analysis and presentation of information is in accordance with national and international best practice.</p>\n<p>The project delivered a suite of oral history recordings from across the Basin, while also developing communication products in the form of radio features and community booklets. This output was deposited with the Mitchell Library of the State Library of New South Wales and the Australian Torres Strait Islander Digital Archive (ATSIDA). Physical copies are held at the Mitchell Library (Accession Record MLOH 647).</p>"

</ul><p>Recent decades have brought an increasing realisation that the health of the Murray-Darling Basin is at risk. An array of pressures ranging from the over allocation of water resources, poor land management planning and the expansion of primary production have all contributed to declines in river health. Fish and their habitats have been greatly affected by these pressures, with estimates suggesting native fish populations are at 10% of pre-European colonisation levels.</p>
<p>As all levels of government explore options for improving the health of the Murray-Darling Basin, the knowledge held by people within the community who have had a lengthy association with the waterways of the Basin is being increasingly recognised as a valuable resource. People&#x2019;s lived experience provides a unique insight into how changes in rivers and their associated habitats have occurred over time. Accessing and recording this information will make a significant contribution to our knowledge of the Murray-Darling Basin, and help shape the management decisions of the future to achieve improved river health outcomes.</p>
<p>Many different groups of people have developed unique relationships with rivers and their associated environments. The long history of recreational fishing within the Basin has led generations of people to spend substantial amounts of time on or near its rivers. Their desire to experience the river and to catch fish has developed a refined understanding of how fish relate to the riverine environment, and consequently how the changes to these environments have affected the status of native fisheries.</p>
<p>Similarly, Indigenous peoples have relationships with the rivers that stretch back tens of thousands of years before the arrival of European colonisers. This strong and lasting association has also allowed Indigenous peoples to witness contemporary changes to the health of the Basin&#x2019;s rivers and observe how these changes have influenced fish and their habitats. In addition, landholders, long-time residents, regular tourists and an array of other community stakeholders hold stories and memories of the river that are an invaluable resource for guiding its future management.</p>
<p>The project represents a unique collaboration between some of Australia&#x2019;s most prominent ecological oral historians (both within tertiary institutions and commercial production companies), all four Basin-state fisheries agencies and regional NRM organisations. The integration of research institutions, government and local community stakeholders provides a diverse and flexible framework to access a wide range of participants and ensure the collection, analysis and presentation of information is in accordance with national and international best practice.</p>
<p>The project delivered a suite of oral history recordings from across the Basin, while also developing communication products in the form of radio features and community booklets. This output was deposited with the Mitchell Library of the State Library of New South Wales and the Australian Torres Strait Islander Digital Archive (ATSIDA). Physical copies are held at the Mitchell Library (Accession Record MLOH 647).</p></span></li></ul></td></tr><tr><th style="white-space: nowrap; width: 1%;">isPartOf</th><td style="text-align:left"> <a href="#./">Dharmae Example Dataset</a></td></tr><tr><th style="white-space: nowrap;

The aim of the research was to understand and interpret differential community responses to MPAs and gain insight into the factors that influence their community acceptance. 

The research took a multi-disciplinary approach in order to explore the full breadth of factors that may be important aspects in determining a community&#x2019;s response to an MPA, including media analysis, history and demographic analysis and social assessment. 

This data collection contains 7 interview transcripts with professional, recreational and Indigenous fishers, conducted in order to answer the research question &apos;What social impacts have been experienced in each marine park community and by which sections of the community?&apos;
